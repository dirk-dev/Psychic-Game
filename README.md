# Psychic-Game

The goal of **Psychic Game** is to guess the random letter the computer has selected. You have 9 chances to guess the letter. 
If you guess the letter correctly within 9 tries, you win that round. If not, you lose.

The game will detect any keystroke the user makes, so be careful what key you press.

This project was a class exercise in JavaScript, as well as some work in CSS and HTML.

**Psychic-Game** was coded by me, and is maintained by me.

The deployed app can be found at https://dirk-kiesewetter.github.io/Psychic-Game/
